### The Feedback sprint 1

Date: 2023-09-21
Feedback given by Leon Bokhorst

We showed what we have made for our sprint. 
it started by us showing our User story

> [As a traveller I want to post my vacation trips and share them with friends.](https://github.com/TravelXPToday/Portfolio/issues/1)

The User Story is to broad is should have been one not two.

We are doing a good job and are working together great. We are far a head of what he expected us to be at after 2 weeks. Leon said that for now it is best to focus on our retrospective to see what can be in proved and where we can focus on next. so the process will be easier. (Leon likes furries?)

### The Feedback sprint 2

Date: 2023-10-05
Feedback given by Leon Bokhorst

We showed what we have made for our sprint.
We also explained the changes we made to our process because of the  retrospective we did last sprint. We showed our front-end and our new progress made.

We are doing a good job and are working together great. We are far a head of what he expected us to be at after the second sprint. Leon said that we take a different focus then Lean and Jimmy but this is fine, there are different ways to Rome. We told Leon that we will be working on CI/CD and other functional parts of our application next.
