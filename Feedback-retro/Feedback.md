### The Feedback sprint 1

Date: 2023-09-21
Feedback given by Leon Bokhorst

We showed what we have made for our sprint. 
it started by us showing our User story

> [As a traveller I want to post my vacation trips and share them with friends.](https://github.com/TravelXPToday/Portfolio/issues/1)

The User Story is to broad is should have been one not two.

We are doing a good job and are working together great. We are far a head of what he expected us to be at after 2 weeks. Leon said that for now it is best to focus on our retrospective to see what can be in proved and where we can focus on next. so the process will be easier. (Leon likes furries?)
