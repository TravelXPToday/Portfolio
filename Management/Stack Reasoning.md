# Our Choice  for front-end
We have decided to use React
Here are some reasons for this decision:
 - The Most popular PRO JavaScript MOC framework.
 - Has extensive userbase what creates a lot of documentation.
 - Works with components and hooks what is useful to learn for the rest of my journey
 - uses a virtual DOM and this is faster most of the time.
 - Want to look at NextJs  and this uses React.

## These frameworks didn't make it.
- Svelte:
	- Svelte's components work without a virtual DOM.
	- Is light weight.
	- Easy to learn.
	- sadly enough it is still very small and niche. This wont create as much job opportunities in the future.
	- I(Art Nooijen) might implement this during my research to see how well this works.
- Vue:
	- scales better than React 
	- Does not provide the templates and addons React provides
	- less popular

**this has been discussed with Leon and he liked it alot**

# Our choice for backend
We wanted to make the choice between Java and Python because these are 2 major programming languages. C# quickly fell off as a programming language for us because we wanted to learn something new. We have already used C# in previous semesters. We first listed the pros and cons of Java and Python:

## Advantages Java:
- Itâ€™s popular so it has a large community for tips and help with problems
Disadvantages Java:
- Not necessarily good in terms of performance
- Decreasing popularity, so perhaps more difficult in terms of maintainability in the future.
- "Difficult" to learn

## Advantages Python:
- Easy to learn
- Compared to Java little code for the same functionality
Disadvantages Python:
- Knowledge not very useful for other languages

Our final choice fell on Python because of its emerging popularity. We think it is important to learn Python because it will be in high demand in the future. It is also easy to integrate AI. Python is also very flexible.
