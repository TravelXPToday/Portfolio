# Our Choice  for front-end
We have decided to use [[PRO React|React]]
Here are some reasons for this decision:
 - The Most popular [[PRO JavaScript MOC]] framework.
 - Has extensive userbase what creates a lot of documentation.
 - Works with components and hooks what is useful to learn for the rest of my journey
 - uses a virtual DOM and this is faster most of the time.
 - Want to look at [[PRO NextJs 13|NextJs]]  and this uses React.

## These frameworks didn't make it.
- Svelte:
	- Svelte's components work without a virtual DOM.
	- Is light weight.
	- Easy to learn.
	- sadly enough it is still very small and niche. This wont create as much job opportunities in the future.
	- Me(Art Nooijen) might implement this during my research to see how well this works.
- Vue:
	- scales better than React 
	- Does not provide the templates and addons React provides
	- less popular
