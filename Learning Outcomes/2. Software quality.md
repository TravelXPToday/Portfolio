## What is software quality and why is it important?
Software quality refers to the degree to which software meets the functional and non-functional requirements that are set for it, such as reliability, efficiency, maintainability, and usability. (Van Der Storm & Vinju, 2022)[^6]

It is important because software plays an increasingly important role in society and business, and software errors can have a significant impact on an organization's reputation and budget. (Compact Magazine et al., 2018)[^7]

### Sonarcloud
#### What is sonarcloud?
Sonarcloud is a cloud based code analysis service designed to detect coding issues in 26 different programming languages.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues on each merge/pull request. It it also possible to integrate sonarcloud into the Ci/Cd process. [^1]

### Testing 
#### Unit testing
##### What is unit testing?
Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually scrutinized for proper operation[^2] [^3] [^4]. A unit can be a function, method, module, object, or other entity in an applicationâ€™s source code[^3]. The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step in the development process because it can detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages[^2] [^3] [^4]. 

Here are some reasons we implement unit testing:

- Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs[^2].
- It helps us and potantialy other devs to understand the testing code base and enables them to make changes quickly[^2].
- Good unit tests serve as project documentation[^2].
- Unit tests help with code re-use[^2].
- Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly (i.e. Regression testing) [^2].
- Unit tests are designed to test single units of code in isolation, and they are quick and easy[^3].

##### Example of our backend unit testing

```python
    @patch('controllers.Traveler.read')
    def test_get_all_travelers(self, mock_read):
        logger.info("\nRunning test_get_all_travelers test case")
        mock_data = [{"name": "Art"}, {"name": "Jelle"}]
        mock_read.return_value = mock_data

        result = get_all_travelers()
        self.assertEqual(result, mock_data)
        logger.debug(f"Mocked data: {mock_data}")
        logger.debug(f"Result: {result}")
```

#### Criteria for data transfer

We set up code in the front and back en to check if the data that is send is valid. This is to prevent errors in the database. We do this by using the following code:

##### Front-end

```javascript

    if (isNaN(Date.parse(formData.startDate)) || isNaN(Date.parse(formData.endDate))) {
      console.error('Invalid date format');
      alert('Invalid date format');
      setLoading(false);
      return;
    }

    if (new Date(formData.startDate) > new Date(formData.endDate)) {
      console.error('End date must be after start date');
      alert('End date must be after start date');
      setLoading(false);
      return;
    }

    if (typeof formData.destination !== 'string' || formData.destination.trim() === '') {
      console.error('Destination must be a non-empty string');
      alert('Destination must be a non-empty string');
      setLoading(false);
      return;
    }
```

Here you can see some of the criteria we use to check if the data is valid. We do this for all the data that is send to the back-end.

##### Back-end

```python

    def create(self, data):
        if 'traveler' in str(self):
            required_fields = ['Email', 'Username']
        elif 'journey' in str(self):
            required_fields = ['name', 'start_time', 'end_time', 'start_location', 'destination', 'mode_of_transport']
        else:
            required_fields = []

        if all(field in data for field in required_fields):
            return self.collection.insert_one(data)
        else:
            missing_fields = [field for field in required_fields if field not in data]
            log_message = f"Validation failed for data: {missing_fields}"
            logging.error(log_message)
            raise ValueError("Missing required information.")
```

Here you can see some of the criteria we use to check if the data is valid. We do this for all the data that is send to the database. We outsourced this to another duo of students. [^9]

#### Front-end testing

We chose Jest for testing in our React application because of its simplicity and flexibility. With Jest, we can efficiently write and manage tests, ensuring our components and overall application functionality are reliable and robust.

##### Problems we faced

We struggled with the necessity to mock the data passed to our components during testing, as we aimed to test the components themselves, not the API. The challenge was amplified because the API call was initiated post-loading, making it difficult to incorporate the data into the component for testing. We overcame this obstacle by utilizing `await screen.findByText('Trip Test')`; from React testing library. This function ensures the component, along with the data, is fully loaded before the commencement of the test.

##### Example of our front-end testing

```javascript
  beforeEach(() => {
    global.fetch = jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve({
      ok: true,
      json: () => Promise.resolve([])
    }));
  });
  
  afterEach(() => {
    jest.restoreAllMocks();
  });

  it('displays loading state initially', () => {
    render(<AllJourneysComponent />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('displays error message when fetch call fails', async () => {
    jest.spyOn(global, 'fetch').mockImplementation(() => Promise.reject('API is down'));
    render(<AllJourneysComponent />);
    await screen.findByText('Error:');
  });
  
  it('displays no journeys message when there are no journeys to display', async () => {
    render(<AllJourneysComponent />);
    await screen.findByText('No journeys to display');
  });
  
  it('renders the create new journey button', async () => {
    render(<AllJourneysComponent />);
    const button = await screen.findByText('Create New Journey');
    expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
it('sets the journey data correctly using mock data', async () => {
  global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
    Promise.resolve({
      ok: true,
      json: () => Promise.resolve([
        {
          _id: "1",
          name: "Test trip",
          date: "2023-10-25",
          start_time: "2023-10-25",
          end_time: "2023-10-29",
          location: "Germany",
          description: "Road trip across the country to Germany with a group of friends.",
          image_url: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1695638327343-f204623e1f85?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1935&q=80",
          travelers: [
            { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" },
            { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" }
          ]
        },
        {
          _id: "1",
          name: "Trip Test",
          date: "2023-10-25",
          start_time: "2023-10-25",
          end_time: "2023-10-29",
          location: "Germany",
          description: "Road trip across the country to Germany with a group of friends.",
          image_url: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1695638327343-f204623e1f85?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1935&q=80",
          travelers: [
            { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" },
            { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" }
          ]
        }
      ])
    })
  );

  render(<BrowserRouter><AllJourneysComponent /></BrowserRouter>);

  const journeyName = await screen.findByText('Test trip');
  const journeyName2 = await screen.findByText('Trip Test');
  expect(journeyName).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(journeyName2).toBeInTheDocument();
  
});

```
We employ Jest to mock global fetch calls and restore them after each test to ensure isolation and prevent interference between tests. We validate various states of our AllJourneysComponent, such as the initial loading state, error handling, and the rendering of journey data using mock data, ensuring our component behaves as expected under different scenarios.
We try to get as high of a coverage as possible.

## Website Testing 

<img src="https://unlighthouse.dev/logo-light.svg" width = "200px" >

We use [Unlighthouse](https://unlighthouse.dev) to test our website. Unlighthouse is a tool that uses Google Lighthouse to test your website. It tests your website on the following aspects:
