# Software Quality
 > You use software **tooling and methodology** that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.
 > 
 >**Tooling and methodology**: Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.[^5]

## What is software quality and why is it important?
Software quality refers to the degree to which software meets the functional and non-functional requirements that are set for it, such as reliability, efficiency, maintainability, and usability. (Van Der Storm & Vinju, 2022)[^6]

It is important because software plays an increasingly important role in society and business, and software errors can have a significant impact on an organization's reputation and budget. (Compact Magazine et al., 2018)[^7]

### Sonarcloud
#### What is sonarcloud?
Sonarcloud is a cloud based code analysis service designed to detect coding issues in 26 different programming languages.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues on each merge/pull request. It it also possible to integrate sonarcloud into the Ci/Cd process. [^1]

### Testing 
#### Unit testing
##### What is unit testing?
Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually scrutinized for proper operation[^2] [^3] [^4]. A unit can be a function, method, module, object, or other entity in an application’s source code[^3]. The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step in the development process because it can detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages[^2] [^3] [^4]. 

Here are some reasons we implement unit testing:

- Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs[^2].
- It helps us and potantialy other devs to understand the testing code base and enables them to make changes quickly[^2].
- Good unit tests serve as project documentation[^2].
- Unit tests help with code re-use[^2].
- Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly (i.e. Regression testing) [^2].
- Unit tests are designed to test single units of code in isolation, and they are quick and easy[^3].

##### Example of our backend unit testing
```python
    @patch('controllers.Traveler.read')
    def test_get_all_travelers(self, mock_read):
        logger.info("\nRunning test_get_all_travelers test case")
        mock_data = [{"name": "Art"}, {"name": "Jelle"}]
        mock_read.return_value = mock_data

        result = get_all_travelers()
        self.assertEqual(result, mock_data)
        logger.debug(f"Mocked data: {mock_data}")
        logger.debug(f"Result: {result}")
```
