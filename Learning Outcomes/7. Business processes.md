# Business processes

 > You can explain **simple** business processes and **relate** them to the development of your software project.
 > 
 >**Simple** : 	Predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.
 >
>**Relate** : 	
understanding the relationships between the process and software.

> To understand the purpose of our application we made 2 business processes. One old and one new, in this way you can see the difference of the process a traveler goes through.
