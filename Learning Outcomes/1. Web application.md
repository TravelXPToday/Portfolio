### Login system

For our login system we use Auth0. Auth0 is an authentication and authorization platform used by developers to add secure user authentication and access control to their applications. It helps manage user identities, enabling single sign-on, social logins, and other authentication methods without developers having to build these systems from scratch. It's a popular tool for simplifying user authentication and ensuring the security of web and mobile applications.

As you can see is is not possible to go to the journey page when you're nog logged in.

When you click on the login button you will see the following login screen. It is possible to create a new account or login into your existing account. You can choose to login with your google account or create an own TravelXPToday account.

# Login in the navbar
We created a responsive navigation bar component using React, tailored for both desktop and mobile views. For authenticated users, it features a 'Journeys' link and an 'AvatarMenu', while non-authenticated users see a 'LoginButton'. The desktop version displays these options in a horizontally aligned list, whereas the mobile version includes a hamburger button that reveals a similar set of options in a dropdown menu. The component is designed with interactive animations and styling, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

The image below shows the navigation bar in its desktop view. The 'Journeys' link and 'AvatarMenu' are visible, as the user is authenticated. if not their is no menu only a login button.

Login button:
