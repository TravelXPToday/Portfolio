 # What is CI-CD

 CI/CD, short for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, automates the building, testing, and deployment of code. This streamlines the workflow, enhances code quality, and accelerates the release of new features or fixes.

## Understanding CI
CI, an abbreviation for Continuous Integration, is a core component of the CI/CD paradigm in software development. It is an automated process where developers integrate their code changes into a shared repository frequently. Each integration is then automatically built and tested to ensure that new changes do not break the existing codebase. The objective is to identify and address conflicts early, fostering a more streamlined and efficient development process.

## Continuous Delivery
This aspect of CI/CD focuses on the automated testing and sharing of code changes. After developers commit their changes, the code undergoes automated tests and is then added to a shared repository. Operations teams can subsequently deploy these changes to the production environment. This practice enhances collaboration between developers and business stakeholders and facilitates effortless deployment of new code iterations.

Continuous Deployment
This process extends beyond Continuous Delivery, automating not just the testing and sharing of code, but also its deployment to production. Every change that passes the automated tests is automatically deployed to the live environment, expediting the software delivery process and eliminating manual interventions.

# Why
In addition to supporting these larger goals, CI/CD enables you to:

`Ship software quickly and efficiently`: CI/CD pipelines move applications from the coding to deployment phases at scale, ensuring that the pace of development matches the needs of the business.

`Increase productivity`: By implementing automated processes, development and operations teams are no longer spending time merging, building, testing, releasing, and deploying software manually. Instead, they can focus on writing better code and monitoring deployments for issues.

`Reduce risk on delivery:` Testing every change before it's deployed ensures that the result will be a higher quality product and lower the rate of bugs in production. Customers will receive a better product, and the development team will spend less time fixing urgent defects discovered after release.

`Incorporate user feedback faster`: CI/CD removes traditional roadblocks for development and operations teams, enabling the faster release of new features to meet users' needs. This will increase customer satisfaction and provide valuable insights into the capabilities that users value for future projects.

`Standardize processes`: Automating the merge, test, delivery, and deployment processes means that they will always follow the same structure. This standardizes the pipeline, whereas manual execution of these tasks always comes with the risk of human error, such as executing tests in a different order.

# How do we implement CI-CD
We implement CI-CD by using the following technologies:
- [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
