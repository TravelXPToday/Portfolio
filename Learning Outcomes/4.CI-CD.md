 # What is CI-CD

 CI/CD, short for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, automates the building, testing, and deployment of code. This streamlines the workflow, enhances code quality, and accelerates the release of new features or fixes.

## Understanding CI

CI, an abbreviation for Continuous Integration, is a core component of the CI/CD paradigm in software development. It is an automated process where developers integrate their code changes into a shared repository frequently. Each integration is then automatically built and tested to ensure that new changes do not break the existing codebase. The objective is to identify and address conflicts early, fostering a more streamlined and efficient development process.

[^2]
## Continuous Delivery
This aspect of CI/CD focuses on the automated testing and sharing of code changes. After developers commit their changes, the code undergoes automated tests and is then added to a shared repository. Operations teams can subsequently deploy these changes to the production environment. This practice enhances collaboration between developers and business stakeholders and facilitates effortless deployment of new code iterations.

Continuous Deployment
This process extends beyond Continuous Delivery, automating not just the testing and sharing of code, but also its deployment to production. Every change that passes the automated tests is automatically deployed to the live environment, expediting the software delivery process and eliminating manual interventions.

[^2]

# Why
In addition to supporting these larger goals, CI/CD enables you to:

> `Ship software quickly and efficiently`: CI/CD pipelines move applications from the coding to deployment phases at scale, ensuring that the pace of development matches the needs of the business.

> `Increase productivity`: By implementing automated processes, development and operations teams are no longer spending time merging, building, testing, releasing, and deploying software manually. Instead, they can focus on writing better code and monitoring deployments for issues.

> `Reduce risk on delivery:` Testing every change before it's deployed ensures that the result will be a higher quality product and lower the rate of bugs in production. Customers will receive a better product, and the development team will spend less time fixing urgent defects discovered after release.

> `Incorporate user feedback faster`: CI/CD removes traditional roadblocks for development and operations teams, enabling the faster release of new features to meet users' needs. This will increase customer satisfaction and provide valuable insights into the capabilities that users value for future projects.

> `Standardize processes`: Automating the merge, test, delivery, and deployment processes means that they will always follow the same structure. This standardizes the pipeline, whereas manual execution of these tasks always comes with the risk of human error, such as executing tests in a different order.

# How do we implement CI-CD
We implement CI-CD by using the following technologies:
- [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)


# front-end

## CI pipeline  

```yaml
name: Running Create React App and Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - DEV
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - DEV

jobs:
  build:
    
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [lts/*]

    steps:
    - name: Cache npm modules
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-npm-
    
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
   
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      working-directory: travelxptoday

    - name: Build
      run: npm run build --if-present
      working-directory: travelxptoday

    - name: Test
      run: npm test -- --coverage
      working-directory: travelxptoday
```
We've created a CI pipeline for our frontend repository. This file activates on push and pull requests on our main and DEV branch. This job runs on a virtual machine with the latest ubuntu operating system. In the matrix strategy we define that is has to use the latest node version. The next step is to cache our npm modules. This improves the speed of the workflow by reusing previously downloaded modules based on our package-lock.json. The checkout code is basically a git clone from to GitHub repository were the workflow is executed. Based on the matrix it installs Node.js. After this it installs dependencies and builds the project. With npm test -- --coverage it runs all our tests automatically and shows a coverage.
## CD

We deploy our front-end on Vercel. This automatically deploys our front-end when we push to the main branch. that is why we want to make sure that before it gets deployed, it passes all the tests.
here are some images as an example of how we deploy our front-end on Vercel.

### Testing environment

Vercel also deploys a version after a pull request to our DEV branch. This means that we can test our code before it gets merged into the main branch. This is a great way to test our code and ensure that it works before it is deployed to the main branch. It is also live, so we can do user testing on it. This means we can implement testing and bug fixing before we really deploy it to the main branch.

# Back-end
## CI pipeline:
```yaml
name: Python application

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - DEV
  pull_request:
    branches: 
      - main
      - DEV
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python 3.10
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"

    - name: Cache pip packages
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-


    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8 pytest pytest-cov mypy  # Added radon and mypy
        pip install -r API/requirements.txt
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi

    - name: Set PYTHONPATH
      run: echo "PYTHONPATH=$PWD" >> $GITHUB_ENV


    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest API/tests/ --cov=API


    - name: Display coverage report
      run: |
        coverage report
        coverage xml


    - name: Type checking with mypy
      run: mypy API --exclude config.py --install-types --non-interactive


    - name: Install newman for API testing
      run: npm install -g newman


    #- name: Run API tests with newman
    # run: newman run API/tests/Travelxptoday.postman_collection.json


    - name: Print Info
      run: |
        echo "TravelXPToday is a platform that brings friends together for shared adventures."
        echo "Everyone can contribute to a journey, add experiences, photos, and memories, creating a collective travel diary."
        echo "Explore the interactive dashboard to relive group adventures and earn unique badges as a team."
        echo "The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight and easy-to-use Python web application framework."
        echo "Security and code quality are ensured with tools like a hidden config file and SonarCloud."
        echo "To run the app locally, follow the instructions in the repository README."
```

We've created a CI pipeline that activates on both push and pull requests to the main and DEV branches. The workflow operates on the latest Ubuntu, seamlessly checking out the code and setting up Python 3.10. With the integration of caching, the installation of dependencies is optimized, leading to expedited build times. Following the installation of dependencies, the PYTHONPATH is configured, paving the way for tests executed with pytest, which now includes a comprehensive coverage report. To uphold the standard of code quality, type checking is conducted using mypy. We are also equipped for API testing with newman, awaiting activation. The process culminates with a print step, offering a detailed overview of the TravelXPToday platform.

### What is Docker?

In TravelXPToday, we've adopted Docker, a tool designed to facilitate the creation, deployment, and running of applications by using containers. Containers enable us to encapsulate our application, TravelXPToday, along with all its dependencies, into a neat package ensuring consistency and reliability.

```yaml
name: Build and Push to Docker Hub

on: 
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - DEV
  pull_request:
    branches: 
      - main
      - DEV

env:
  IMAGE_NAME: travelxptoday
  DOCKERFILE_PATH: API/Dockerfile

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    name: Build and Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3   

    - name: Get PR Title
      if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
      run: |
        PR_TITLE=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.number }} | jq -r .title)
        PR_TITLE=$(echo "$PR_TITLE PR:@${{ github.event.number }}" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/-/g')  # Make the PR title Docker tag friendly
        echo "PR_TITLE=$PR_TITLE" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1 
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

    - name: Build and Push Docker Image
      id: docker_build
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2 
      with:
        context: .
        file: ${{ env.DOCKERFILE_PATH }}
        push: true
        tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && env.PR_TITLE || github.ref_name }}
      
    - name: Print Image SHA
      run: echo "Docker Image SHA - ${{ steps.docker_build.outputs.digest }}"

```

Our CD pipeline, "Build and Push to Docker Hub," is engineered to respond to both push and pull requests on the main and DEV branches. In an environment hosted on the latest Ubuntu, the first action is the retrieval of the codebase. If triggered by a pull request, a unique Docker tag, derived from the title of the pull request, is generated. A secure login into Docker Hub precedes the core of the process: building the Docker image. Utilizing the Dockerfile at API/Dockerfile in the back-end, an image labeled travelxptoday is constructed and then pushed to Docker Hub. Each image bears a distinct tag, ensuring immediate identification and traceability created by the special process demonstrated before. The conclusion of the process is marked by the display of the image's SHA, a final touch for enhanced tracking and accountability.
