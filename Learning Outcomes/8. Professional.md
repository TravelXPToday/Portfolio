## Kanban
We use a Kanban board for our backlog, sprint planning, and review tasks. This allows us to have a complete overview of all the work that needs to be done for the project. The backlog consists of tasks that need to be completed throughout the project. In the sprint planning, we place tasks for the respective sprint. The review section contains topics we still want to show to the instructor. Click [here](https://github.com/orgs/TravelXPToday/projects/1) to view our Kanban board.

## Timeline
Within our project, we use a timeline. During our standup at the beginning of the week, we place on our timeline what we will be working on each day. This is an estimate of the tasks we will undertake during that week. This way, you can always see who is working on what (or has been working on). Additionally, you can look back in the past to see which day a particular topic was addressed. See our timeline [here](https://github.com/orgs/TravelXPToday/projects/1/views/3).

## Issues
For a comprehensive overview of the issues we are currently addressing or have addressed, we regularly refer to the summary. Here, we can, for example, view which issues are associated with each learning outcome. This provides us with a useful overview of which learning outcomes still require work. Additionally, we can filter by Frontend, Backend, and Portfolio. This allows us to prioritize the direction with the most issues and address them first. For an overview of our issues follow [this link](https://github.com/orgs/TravelXPToday/projects/1/views/2)
