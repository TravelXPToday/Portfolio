# What is Agile

Agile is a project management and product development approach that prioritizes flexibility and collaboration, allowing teams to quickly adapt to changes and deliver incremental value to stakeholders. [^4]

## Why we implement a Agile 

We implement a Agile method because it is a very good way to work in a team. It is also very prominent in the ICT environment and it is a good skill to have. It makes the precess of developing software more efficient and it is a good way to keep track of the progress of the project. We do this using [github projects](https://github.com)

## How do we implement Agile

### Scrum
Scrum is an agile project management framework that emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. It encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve. Scrum has a set of meetings, tools, and roles for efficient project delivery, and teams work in short sprints to deliver increments of valuable work in cycles of one month or less. [^3]

we implement scrum  using the following:

This consists of:
    -kanban board
    -timeline
    -issues
